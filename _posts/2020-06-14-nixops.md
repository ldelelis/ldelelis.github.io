# AWS

## Step-by-step commands

* [reimu@hakurei:~/IaC/NixOps/Example]$ nixops create ./entrypoint.nix targets/aws.nix -d example
  * Create the named deployment, specifying its details and deployment target
* [reimu@hakurei:~/IaC/NixOps/Example]$ nixops deploy -d example
  * execute the named deployment
* [reimu@hakurei:~/IaC/NixOps/Example]$ nixops ssh -d example webserver
  * access "webserver" instance of the "example" deployment via an ssh wrapper
* [reimu@hakurei:~/IaC/NixOps/Example]$ nixops ssh -d example webserver
  * destroy resources related to the "example" deployment
  * yes/no confirmation is prompted for every resource. will investigate if there's a force option
    * CONFIRMED: `--confirm` flag exists
    * otherwise, piping `yes` works

## Trivial example

* requires either aws cli setup, or a specific format for keys, which is only mentioned in example
  * that is, either ~/.aws/credentials (CLI), or ~/.ec2-keys
  * format for ~/.ec2-keys is.... odd. it's a space-separated file on the format
    * ID SECRET NAME
  * it's probably better to setup via awscli
  * env vars are also accepted
* region must be declared on a per project basis?
  * will review existing docs if there's a way to pick up a default one. maybe aws cli config?
* nixops still names its automated key pair as "charon" (previous nixops project name)
* default security group does not appear to work...
  * will research how to adjust a correct SG
  * will research if nixops allows handling resources other than ec2 instances
* default "sanity check" consists of enabled ssh access. this is bad for non-accessible instances
  * will review if this can be disabled/altered
  * timeout appears to be extremely long as well
* trivial deployment created two resources
  * one EC2 instances
  * one ec2-keypair
* resulting instance(s) can be reached with `nixops ssh` wrapper
  * will research if it's possible to access manually
  * for now, key pair is nowhere to be found :upside_down_smile:
* no apparent way of handling "outputs" a la terraform
* if using a `let .. in` scheme, resources MUST be defined inside the `in` block
  * this doesn't seem to be specified on docs... will review

## Further research

* example of multi-region deployment?
* helper functions?
  * example: security group formula is really generic, could be extracted to a function

## Environment

* document used tools. vim + nix-vim?
* document installed tools and versions. nixops, aws-cli
  * used awscli package, which is still on v1

## Sidetracks

* aws cli 2.0 not packaged, and overlays dont work OOTB. consider working on this
* nix-env returns nothing on trying to uninstall an existing package
  * this is unrelated to nixops, but there's been an unaddressed issue for this since 2015
